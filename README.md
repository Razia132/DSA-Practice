# DSA-Practice
📘 Data Structures & Algorithms – Topic-wise Practice (Python)

This repository contains Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems solved using Python, organized topic-wise for better clarity and structured learning.

Topics the i will be Covering

Arrays

Strings

Linked Lists

Stacks & Queues

Recursion(important)

Searching & Sorting

Hashing

Trees

Graphs

Dynamic Programming

Greedy Algorithms

-->The goal of this repository is to:

Strengthen problem-solving and logical thinking

Practice interview-oriented DSA problems

Write clean, optimized, and readable code

Maintain consistency through regular updates

All solutions focus on time and space optimization and are added gradually as part of continuous learning.
