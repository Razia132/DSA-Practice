#leanrt union of arrays initially thought of removing duplicates from each array and combine them but y not use 2 pointerr

Also today i spoke to an amazing person who is working in Microsoft ,
His insights truly inspired me and helped to focus any one things rather than more ,
even though its one we have to truly keep our heart and soul and learn in depth like python i mean without dsa its impossible to get in IT industry also got to know about many things in python like selenium and automation .
By his words i understood that wherever you are ,whatever you did in past doesn't matter what truly matters is your capability of adaptation.
