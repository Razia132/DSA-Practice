# 📌 Arrays – DSA Notes & Problems

Arrays are one of the fundamental data structures used to store elements in a contiguous memory location.

## 📖 Concepts that i will Cover
- Traversing an array
- Finding maximum & minimum
- Reversing an array
- Frequency counting
- Prefix sum
- Two-pointer technique

## 🧠 Key Notes
- Arrays allow **O(1)** access using index
- Best used when size is fixed
- Time complexity depends on operation:
  - Access: O(1)
  - Search: O(n)

## 🧩 Problems Included
Each problem contains:
- Problem statement
- Approach explanation
- Python implementation
- Time & space complexity
