Arrays: Left Rotation
def rotLeft(a, d):
    # Write your code here
    n=len(a)
    d=d%n
    temp=[]
    for i in range(0,d):
        temp.append(a[i])
    for i in range(d,n):
        a[i-d]=a[i]
    for i in range(n-d,n):
        a[i]=temp[i-(n-d)]
    return a

it was tricky initially later onnn i did itt with 
learnings-we have to add elements of array to new arrayy ny append() not just assign 
         -return array after completionn
